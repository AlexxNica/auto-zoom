Browser Auto Zoom is an experimental feature for Chrome which automatically
zooms web pages based on their content.

Many sites can be difficult to read without zooming. They may not consider
differences in monitor size and individual users may have different preferences
or needs regarding the size of the content of the page (e.g. differences in
visual acuity or viewing distance). Currently users have the option of changing
the default zoom factor, but this does not account for differences between
web pages. Users then have to manually zoom or reposition themselves to see
better.

This extension analyses the style of the page to compute and set an appropriate
zoom factor automatically.
